# Sum of numbers in a list
This code prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separating them by space then computes their sum and gives it as 
output.

# How it works
Function sum_num():
1. This function does the operation of adding the users input

While True loop:
1. checks if the values are real numbers
2. If not an error message is printed informing user that all values should be real numbers
3. user is asked to input the values again
