# Reversing strings
This code asks the user to input a string. 
The string is then manually read from the end of the string and displayed as a reversed string.
# How it works
Function reverse_string:
1. 's' is initialized as an empty string to store the result
2. input is taken from the user.
3. the input is changed to a list so that it can be indexed

For loop:
1. a negative index is used to access the characters from the end of the string.
2. it over each index and the result is stored in 's' in its reversed order
