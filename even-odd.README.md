# Checking for odd and even
This checks if numbers entered by user are odd or even
# How it works
While True loop:
1. asks user to input a value
2. this loop runs until user enters 'done'.

Inside the loop
1. input is taken to be a string
2. if 'done' is entered the loop breaks
3. if else checks for ood or even
4. error message is printed if a number or 'done' is not entered

The user puts in a value one at a time.
It's tested for odd or even.
